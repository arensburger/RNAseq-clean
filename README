File clean_pair2.pl does the same as clean_pair.pl but it does:
1) try to find overlaps between pairs and turn these into single unpaired reads using FLASH
2) collapse the unpaired reads into single file using FASTX

# July 2012 scripts for cleanning up RNAseq data prior to assembly

Test data are provided: "t1.fq" and "t2.fq"

**Cleaning paired data **
Paired data are assumed to be provided as two FASTQ formated files.  Both files must contain the same number of sequences, pairing is determined by the order of the sequences.
Example of running paired data:

"perl clean_pair.pl -1 t1.fq -2 t2.fq -o h1 -d temp"

This takes as input files t1.fq and t2.fq and produces a directory called "temp" with file headings called "h1"

**Cleaning unpaired data **
"perl clean_single.pl -r t1.fq -o h1 -d temp" 

**updated the file arthropod_ribosome.fas, Crystal Chaw added some spider sequences, see email on Aug 12, 2012 from her
